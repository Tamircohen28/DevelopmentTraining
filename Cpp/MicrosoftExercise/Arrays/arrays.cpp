Solution Explanation
Runtime Complexity
The runtime complexity of this solution is linear, O(n).

Memory Complexity
The memory complexity of this solution is linear, O(n).


Solution Breakdown
In this solution, you can use the following algorithm to find a pair that add up to the target (say val).

Scan the whole array once and store visited elements in a hash set.
During scan, for every element e in the array, we check if val - e is present in the hash set i.e. val - e is already visited.
If val - e is found in the hash set, it means there is a pair (e, val - e) in array whose sum is equal to the given val.
If we have exhausted all elements in the array and didnâ€™t find any such pair, the function will return false.

// Unordered sets are containers that store unique elements in no
// particular order, and which allow for fast retrieval of individual elements based on their value.

        // otherwise it returns an iterator to unordered_set::end (the element past the end of the container).
